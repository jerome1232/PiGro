# PiGro

This project utilizes an Arduino Uno paired with a Raspberry Pi 3b+ (though any Raspberry Pi would work), to automate a small greenhouse and host a local website which allows you to view visualizations of the greenhouse statistics. Things like temperature, humidity levels and etc...

### Major TODO's

- [ ] Get Pi communicating thresholds back to arduino.
- [ ] Move from static graphs to interactive graphs.
- [ ] Get the graphs to update as new data comes in.
